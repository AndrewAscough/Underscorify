AIGHT SO:
	UNDERSCORIFY:
		String is being extracted from a comment (see parserU) (this is because its stored in the hashtable and really adds to the aesthetic)
		So yknow when you #include "myclass.h", well we run that thru the code and the code doesnt update it to be: #include "myclassU.h".....
			This is a very large big annoyance (Ooft, as the millenials would say) because a big part of my code was to ignore lines starting with #

	PARSER:
		cant handle /**/ comments
